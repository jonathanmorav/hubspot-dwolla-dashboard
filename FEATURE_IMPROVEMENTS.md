# Feature Improvements Implementation Guide

## Overview
This document details the implementation plan for high-value improvements identified through deep analysis of support team needs.

---

## 1. Smart Cross-Platform Data Correlation 🔗

### Objective
Automatically connect HubSpot and Dwolla data using the `dwolla_id` field to provide a unified customer view.

### Technical Implementation

#### 1.1 Data Correlation Service
Create `src/utils/dataCorrelation.ts`:

```typescript
interface CorrelatedCustomerData {
  hubspot: {
    company?: HubSpotCompany
    contacts: HubSpotContact[]
  }
  dwolla: {
    customer?: DwollaCustomer
    transfers: DwollaTransfer[]
  }
  correlation: {
    isLinked: boolean
    linkType: 'dwolla_id' | 'email' | 'name_match' | 'none'
    confidence: number
    inconsistencies: DataInconsistency[]
  }
}

interface DataInconsistency {
  field: string
  hubspotValue: any
  dwollaValue: any
  severity: 'warning' | 'error'
  message: string
}
```

#### 1.2 Correlation Logic
- **Primary match**: HubSpot company `dwolla_id` → Dwolla customer `id`
- **Secondary match**: Email address matching
- **Tertiary match**: Fuzzy name matching with confidence scoring

#### 1.3 UI Changes
Update `SearchResults` to include correlation data:
- Add visual link indicator between panels
- Highlight connected accounts with matching border colors
- Show confidence badge (e.g., "95% match")
- Display warning icons for inconsistencies

### Visual Design
```
┌─────────────────────────────┐  🔗  ┌─────────────────────────────┐
│ HubSpot                     │ ←──→ │ Dwolla                      │
│ ✓ Acme Corp                 │      │ ✓ Acme Corporation          │
│   dwolla_id: abc-123        │      │   id: abc-123               │
│                             │      │                             │
│ ⚠️ Address mismatch         │      │                             │
└─────────────────────────────┘      └─────────────────────────────┘
```

## 2. Search History with Smart Suggestions 🕐

### Objective
Reduce repetitive searching by intelligently tracking and suggesting previous searches.

### Technical Implementation

#### 2.1 Search History Store
Create `src/utils/searchHistory.ts`:

```typescript
interface SearchHistoryEntry {
  id: string
  query: string
  timestamp: number
  resultCount: number
  queryType: 'email' | 'name' | 'business'
  frequency: number // Times searched
  lastAccessed: number
}

interface SearchPattern {
  type: 'frequently_searched' | 'recently_searched' | 'similar_pattern'
  entries: SearchHistoryEntry[]
}
```

#### 2.2 Storage Strategy
- Use `chrome.storage.local` with 20-entry limit
- Clear on logout but persist across sessions
- Track frequency and recency for smart ordering

#### 2.3 UI Components

**Recent Searches Dropdown**:
```typescript
interface RecentSearchesProps {
  onSelect: (query: string) => void
  isVisible: boolean
}
```

**Implementation Details**:
- Show on search input focus
- Display last 5 searches with timestamps
- Keyboard navigation (up/down arrows)
- Quick clear option

### Keyboard Shortcuts
- `Cmd/Ctrl + K`: Focus search
- `Cmd/Ctrl + 1-5`: Quick access to top 5 recent searches
- `Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + K`: Clear search history

---

## 3. Contextual Quick Actions ⚡

### Objective
Embed intelligent action buttons based on customer state to eliminate tab switching.

### Technical Implementation

#### 3.1 Action Engine
Create `src/utils/quickActions.ts`:

```typescript
interface QuickAction {
  id: string
  label: string
  icon: string
  type: 'link' | 'copy' | 'api_call' | 'modal'
  isAvailable: (data: CorrelatedCustomerData) => boolean
  execute: (data: CorrelatedCustomerData) => Promise<void>
}

// Example actions
const QUICK_ACTIONS: QuickAction[] = [
  {
    id: 'view_verification',
    label: 'View Verification Requirements',
    icon: '🔍',
    type: 'modal',
    isAvailable: (data) => 
      data.dwolla.customer?.status === 'unverified',
    execute: async (data) => {
      // Show verification requirements inline
    }
  },
  {
    id: 'copy_details',
    label: 'Copy Customer Details',
    icon: '📋',
    type: 'copy',
    isAvailable: () => true,
    execute: async (data) => {
      // Format and copy to clipboard
    }
  }
]
```

#### 3.2 Action Categories

**Status-Based Actions**:
- Unverified → "View verification requirements"
- Suspended → "View suspension reason"
- Recent failure → "Check failure details"

**Data Actions**:
- "Copy formatted details" (for tickets)
- "Copy Dwolla ID"
- "Open in HubSpot" (deep link)
- "Open in Dwolla Dashboard" (deep link)

**Correlation Actions**:
- "Link accounts" (when dwolla_id missing)
- "Update HubSpot record" (sync data)
- "Report inconsistency"

#### 3.3 UI Implementation
Add action buttons to each customer card:
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ 👤 John Doe (Unverified)            │
│ john@example.com                    │
│                                     │
│ [🔍 Verify] [📋 Copy] [🔗 Open]    │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

## Conclusion

These improvements transform the extension from a passive data viewer into an active support assistant. The focus remains on practical, high-impact features that directly address the daily pain points of a small support team.

Implementation priority should follow user value: correlation first (immediate time savings), then search history (builds efficiency), and finally quick actions (workflow optimization).

 Plan to Fix OAuth Authentication State Persistence

     Problem Analysis:

     1. OAuth authentication is working correctly (tokens are being exchanged and stored)
     2. The popup closes after authentication (normal Chrome behavior)
     3. When reopening the popup, the UI doesn't reflect the authenticated state
     4. The auth check is happening in useEffect but the storage might not be updated yet

     Solution Plan:

     1. Update the service worker to notify the popup of auth success:
       - After successful token storage in storeTokens(), send a message to any open popups
       - Add a runtime message to notify successful authentication
     2. Enhance the popup to listen for auth state changes:
       - Add a message listener in App.tsx to update auth state when notified
       - Add chrome.storage.onChanged listener to react to storage changes
       - Force a re-check of auth status after the popup receives focus
     3. Fix timing issues in auth status check:
       - The checkAuthStatus() function checks both chrome.storage.local and chrome.storage.session
       - Ensure the service worker waits for storage operations to complete before returning success
     4. Add a small delay or retry mechanism:
       - When the popup opens, add a slight delay before checking auth status
       - Or implement a retry mechanism if auth status appears false but tokens exist

     Files to modify:

     1. /dist/service-worker.js - Add notification after successful auth
     2. /src/popup/App.tsx - Add listeners for auth state changes
     3. /src/utils/auth.ts - Ensure storage operations are properly awaited

     Implementation steps:

     1. Update service worker to broadcast auth success
     2. Add storage change listeners in the popup
     3. Add focus event listener to recheck auth when popup opens
     4. Test the complete OAuth flow to ensure state persists

     The user is experiencing an issue where OAuth authentication completes 
  successfully for both services, but when they reopen the extension, the 
  authentication state is not persisted - they're back at the login screen.

  Let me think through the potential sources of this issue:

  1. Chrome Storage Session vs Local Storage: 
    - We're using chrome.storage.session for tokens, which persists across 
  popup closes but NOT across browser restarts
    - We're using chrome.storage.local for authentication flags
    - The auth check in auth.ts checks both storages
  2. Service Worker Lifecycle:
    - Service workers can be terminated and restarted by Chrome
    - When the popup closes and reopens, the service worker might be in a 
  different state
    - The service worker might not be properly initialized when the popup 
  checks auth
  3. Timing Issues:
    - The popup might be checking auth before the storage operations complete
    - The auth check happens in a useEffect, but storage operations are async
  4. Storage API Behavior:
    - chrome.storage.session might not be persisting between popup sessions 
  as expected
    - There might be a Chrome bug or behavior we're not accounting for
  5. Auth Check Logic:
    - The isAuthenticated function in auth.ts checks for token existence in 
  session storage
    - If session storage is cleared between popup opens, this would fail
