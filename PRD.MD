# Product Requirements Document: Unified Customer Dashboard

## 1. Executive Summary
A Chrome extension that provides support teams with a unified view of customer data from HubSpot and Dwolla, eliminating context switching and reducing task completion time by consolidating customer information into a single, secure interface.

## 2. Problem Statement
Support and technical teams currently spend excessive time switching between HubSpot and Dwolla to gather customer information, resulting in:
- Extended task completion times (current average: 8-10 minutes per lookup)
- Increased cognitive load from context switching
- Risk of missing critical payment or customer information
- Inconsistent data viewing across team members

## 3. Solution Overview
A secure, read-only Chrome extension that:
1. Accepts email, name, or business name as search input
2. Fetches real-time data from HubSpot and Dwolla APIs
3. Displays consolidated customer information in a unified dashboard
4. Maintains zero data persistence for security compliance

## 4. User Personas & Use Cases

### Primary Users
- **Support Team Members** (3-4 users): Handle customer inquiries, payment issues
- **Technical Support Specialists** (2-3 users): Troubleshoot integration and technical issues

### Key Use Cases
1. **Payment Issue Investigation**
   - Agent receives payment-related inquiry
   - Searches customer by email/name

2. **Onboarding Status Check**
   - Support checks customer's onboarding progress
   - Views both CRM status and payment setup
   - Provides accurate update to customer

## 10. Risks & Mitigation
| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| API rate limits | High | Implement caching strategy, request throttling |
| Token expiration | Medium | Automatic refresh, clear user messaging |
| Data mismatch | Medium | Email validation, fuzzy matching options |
| Extension restrictions | Low | Ensure compliance with Chrome Web Store policies |

## 11. Open Questions
1. Should we add export functionality for transfer history?
2. Do we need to display more than the last 50 transfers?
3. Should we include visual charts for transfer trends?
4. Is there a need for team-wide analytics?
