## Phase 2: Backend Service Deployment

The backend service handles OAuth token exchange securely. Choose ONE deployment option:

### Option A: Railway (Recommended - Easiest)

1. **Prepare GitHub:**
   - Ensure your code is pushed to GitHub
   - Backend code is in `/backend` folder

2. **Deploy to Railway:**
   - Go to https://railway.app/
   - Sign up/login with GitHub
   - Click "New Project"
   - Select "Deploy from GitHub repo"
   - Choose your repository
   - Set root directory to `/backend`

3. **Configure Environment Variables:**
   ```
   API_KEY=generate-a-secure-random-string-here
   HUBSPOT_CLIENT_ID=your-hubspot-client-id
   HUBSPOT_CLIENT_SECRET=your-hubspot-client-secret
   DWOLLA_CLIENT_ID=your-dwolla-client-id
   DWOLLA_CLIENT_SECRET=your-dwolla-client-secret
   DWOLLA_ENVIRONMENT=sandbox
   ALLOWED_EXTENSION_IDS=your-extension-id
   PORT=3001
   ```

4. **Deploy:**
   - Click "Deploy"
   - Copy your deployment URL (e.g., `https://your-app.railway.app`)

### Option B: Vercel

1. **Install Vercel CLI:**
   ```bash
   npm i -g vercel
   ```

2. **Deploy:**
   ```bash
   cd backend
   vercel
   ```

3. **Configure environment variables in Vercel dashboard**

4. **Note your URL:** `https://your-app.vercel.app`

### Option C: Heroku

1. **Create Heroku app:**
   ```bash
   heroku create your-app-name
   ```

2. **Deploy backend:**
   ```bash
   cd backend
   git init
   heroku git:remote -a your-app-name
   git add .
   git commit -m "Backend service"
   git push heroku main
   ```

3. **Set environment variables:**
   ```bash
   heroku config:set API_KEY=your-secure-key
   # ... set all other variables
   ```

### üîí Security Note for API_KEY

Generate a secure API_KEY using:
```bash
openssl rand -base64 32
```
Or use an online generator: https://randomkeygen.com/

# Optional: Development overrides
# VITE_BACKEND_API_URL=http://localhost:3001
```
